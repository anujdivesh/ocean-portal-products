# Wave and Wind Forecast
## Brief
Wave and wind forecast information is available with a lead time of seven days. Parameters available are wave height (wind-sea and swell), wave direction, wave period, and wind speed with direction. The wave forecast should be used as an indicator of large wave events that may be travelling towards a particular region. The model may not account for local effects in the coastal zone. However, when there are large offshore waves travelling towards a coastal region, the waves experienced along the coast will generally be larger than normal as well. It is recommended that the wave forecast be accessed repeatedly in the days leading up to the time when wave information is critical, as there are likely to be at least subtle changes in the forecast.

## Introduction
The ocean surface is often observed as having an uneven and chaotic nature. What we are observing is the combination of many waves of different size and speed travelling in different directions. The waves may have been produced by local winds, referred to as wind-sea, or could have been created many kilometres away from distant storms, referred to as swell.

The wave parameters available in the Ocean Portal as part of the wave forecast, describe the attributes of the most significant wind-sea and swell waves, as well as a description of the wave height when wind-sea and swell are combined. The table below shows what the resulting significant wave height can be when wind-sea and swell are combined.
